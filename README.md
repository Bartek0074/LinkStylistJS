# LinkStylistJS

Nice application where you can style your links.</br>
Currently I'm working on code generator.</br>
In this app I was working with gulp, CSS (with BEM) and JavaScript.</br>
At the beginning I was working with SASS, but i switched to CSS, because JavaScript does'nt see SASS variables.
